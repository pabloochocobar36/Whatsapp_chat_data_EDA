:: S to C and C to A::
 Because A is directed to C.. So there is no path to go to A.
So we have join like
 ::S to A and A to C:: or ::S to C and S to A:: as in both case the weight is same.

Ek village mein upper caste lower caste ek sath school padte the. 

Toh lower caste ka ek baccha intelligent aur toper tha. 
Voh jald ias bane wala tha. Yeh baat upper caste se mehsus nhi hoyi toh unhone uske batkana chaya. 
Isliye lower caste ke bacche ke dost ban gye. Aur free mein nashe karne lage fir ek din jab woh bacha nasedi ban gya aur ghar se nikaal diya gya ,toh usse se dosti tod di,aur behijat(disrespect) karke nikal diya. 
Aaj us bacche ko sab nasedi aur ganda baccha bolte aur woh garib bhi hai. 

At the end upper caste upper rhe aur woh lower ka lower haii.

05/01/2020, 5:39 pm - Hassan Jh: SOS from the one of the organisers of Shaheen Bagh protest: Delhi Police and CRPF have reached there and already removed the barricades the local community had out in place to keep control over the protest
 They have been asked to vacate by tonight or maximum by tomorrow after which there is very strong fear that force will be used. Amit Shah has some inauguration in Noida for which he has demanded that the protest be cleared as he he is bent upon using that route. 
MASS MOBILISATION is required there ASAP.  It is time for you to show up right now in large numbers. Special shout out to Media people. 

Please share widely. This is verified information because I received a call from one of the people who have been key to ensuring the protest continues, whom I have met on several occasions. Please reach Shaheen Bagh ASAP.
05/01/2020, 5:39 pm - Hassan Jh: Police force has reached Shaheen Bagh...please spread the word...barricading has begun...if people can reach it might strengthen the spirit of those who are the site

27/04/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 98703 34388: A lot of Batch 2 students are asking me, “when and where to send the Lab File Programs”. But I will like to tell you that I really haven’t received any reply or response or call yet. If I had received some information, I would have definitely shared the same on the group. The theory ma’am has already said the batch 2 students also have to complete the same lab programs, but she didn’t reply about when and where to submit or send. Yes, on request of some students, she asked contact number of a batch 2 student. What I think is, batch 2 students are really never cared by the faculties. Do we pay less fee or should we write to our HOD? We can just keep our programs written and ready. If she would need the lab file, then let her contact us. We can’t be running with our files and trying to contact her.

01/06/2020, 12:51 am - Hassan Jh: Greetings!!

Amidst this pandemic and unprecedented times, I wish & pray that everyone is safe & healthy.

Although both men and women are equally being affected by COVID 19, research on previous epidemics, such as SARS and Ebola, indicates that women are impacted differently by health crises  and epidemics than men. 

Women are often the main caregivers in their homes, communities and health facilities, which puts them at higher risks. Incidences and reports of violence against women within the household have also risen due to lock`down. All these things put a great deal of psychological stress on them. 

Keeping these points in view, Women Cell, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jamia Hamdard is organizing a Webinar on "COVID 19 Pandemic: Impact of Lockdown on personal and Professional Life of Women" on 04-06-2020 The Thursday, at 11:00 am

As men and women have to go hand in hand with each other in fighting this pandemic, so I invite all of you to participate in this event. We have eminent personalities from various spheres of life with us who would share their experiences and ideas for dealing with this crisis. 

The Webinar Flyer is attached with this mail.

There is No registration fee.

For registration, please click on https://forms.gle/i8yYTqUSJpwcUjeZ7

Please register in large numbers and derive maximum benefit. Circulate it amongst your friends and colleagues.  Participants will also get a Participation Certificate.

Looking forward to the pleasure of meeting and interacting with you in this Webinar.

18/06/2020, 7:05 pm - Ansab Jh: Hi everyone,

I am glad to be a part of GFG Campus Ambassador Program for session 20-21. I would take this moment to thank you all.

It’s time to make our coding community reach new heights and with the help of GFG, we can make this dream come true.

As we all know, geeksforgeeks is the best site to learn coding and concepts of programming languages. It is also famous for placement preparation in product based companies.


As we all know, Getting placed in product based companies like Google, Amazon, etc is a tough nut to crack and with COVID, situations are getting worse.

I simply believe in executing rather than speaking. 

Hence, I am providing you with a google form in which you can list your problems, any kind of help you seek from geeksforgeeks: like career counselling, discount coupon on the courses, webinars on any certain topics, etc.

GeeksforGeeks is planning multiple things for students like us and it would be great if we could show them how they can help us.

24/05/2021, 1:35 pm - Ansab Jh: Dear Professor Dr.Sameena,

 

A few days back I wrote to you about Summer Training and Internship Opportunity for students of Jamia Hamdard university. This is a gentle reminder that the 25th of May 2021, i.e. tomorrow is the last date to avail the opportunity.

 
 

New summer internship opportunities

Since the time for the summer internships is coming close, many students and college faculty have requested us for offering scholarships on our trainings. Keeping this in mind we have re-initiated the scholarships on the following trainings:

 

A. Internet of Things and Machine Learning Training (Ideal for the students of circuit branches such as Electronics, Electrical, Instrumentation etc.)

 

 

B. Web Development Training (Ideal for the students of software branches such as Computer Science, Information Technology etc.)

 

 

 

What are the steps to earn the Scholarship and Internship?
  

To avail the scholarship, the students have to answer a scholarship test and qualify for the same by scoring at-least 70% marks.
This is a short test and will not take more than 10 minutes of the students' time. This ensures that they can answer it without spending much time if they have exams ongoing.

 

Step 1: As a first step, students will have to answer a scholarship test to be eligible for the internship. They are free to choose the training they want and will have to answer the respective scholarship test. They could answer both as well.

 

A. Web Development Training: Scholarship link for the students of Jamia Hamdard university

 

https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship

 

OR

 

B. Internet of Things and Machine Learning Training: Scholarship link for the students of Jamia Hamdard university

 

https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship

 

 

The selected students will be invited to join the training at an 80% discount. We charge a small fee to cover our costs and to ensure that only interested students join the program. 

 

 

Step 2: Our team of developers will train the students on the concepts via online video training.

 


Step 3: Upon completion of the training, the students will be issued a training certificate which can be submitted to the college as per the  MHRD and AICTE rules.

 

 

Step 4 (Paid Internship): Upon completion of the training, students will then be invited to apply for an internship at various organisations who are looking to hire.

 

 

OR

 

 

Step 4 (Assured Internship): Upon completion of the training, every student will be assigned a unique project, based on their learnings during the trainings. These projects will be based on our requirements for our various industrial product development like Blake(Temperature Humidity Monitoring for Pharmaceutical companies), Bolt IoT and ML platform, etc. Upon completing this project, they will be provided with a technical internship completion certificate.

 

 

 

 

Internship Opportunities upon Training Completion

 

Summer Internship Opportunities for your students

Upon completion of the Bolt's IoT and ML OR Web Development Training, students will be invited to apply for an internship at various organisations who are looking to hire, including Bolt IoT. These companies will hire based on performance during the training, resume submitted and interview round.
We have tied up with reputed companies all over India, through which students can earn a stipend of upto Rs. 20,000/- per month.
All these companies are hiring for work from home technical internships.
You can get more details here: https://info.boltiot.com/internshipopportunities.
 

Assured Summer Internship Opportunities for your students

The number of paid internship opportunities are limited, but we want to ensure that students get assured hands on experience through an internship opportunity. We will be providing an assured internship to every student who enrols and completes either of the online training. While our trainings already ensure that they build projects, we also want them to get some industrial exposure by working on projects that have already been deployed in real-time.

This will be a work from home internship, due to the current traveling constraints.
Since providing training physically is impossible in the current scenario, we will train them online with our team members constantly mentoring the students.
Upon completion of the training, we will assign a unique project for every student based on our product development requirement. The student will have to submit this project, upon which they will get the internship certificate that they can submit to the college.
The students will also get a certificate of completion of the training. This is an industrial training completion certificate since they will be building hands-on projects during the training.
 

 

Other critical points:
The option of full refund: In case the students are not happy with the training offered to them, then they can get a full refund as per the refund policy. This ensures that there is no risk for students or the faculty involved in the process. 
Lifetime access: Students can register now and start the training after the exams or at any other time.
 

Terms and conditions

This invitation is only valid for students of Jamia Hamdard university and cannot be shared with students of any other institute.
The last date to avail the scholarship is TOMORROW, 25th of May 2021. Keeping this in mind, we request you to forward the details of this opportunity to your students at the earliest. 

Next action for faculty

We request you to forward the details of this opportunity to your students at the earliest. You may share it with them via Email, Notice Board, WhatsApp and other channels as well.

 

 

You can share the link directly on WhatsApp from here: https://info.boltiot.com/whatsappshare
